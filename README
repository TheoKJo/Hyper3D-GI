## Implemented

* CPU Raytracer (not fully optimized)
* Sherical harmonics calculation functions

## Working on...

* Precomputed Radiance Transfer(PRT) shadowed-diffuse sample (using irrlicht open source engine)
* GPU Raytracer (CUDA first, then OpenCL)
* Real-time radiosity (without lightmap-baking)
* Test cases using gtest (Google C++ Testing Framework)

## And.. later...

* Lightmap baking
* Many interesting techniques mainly about spherical harmonics
* Interactive photon mapping
