Static(off-line) Global Illumination Engine

## Implemented

* CPU Raytracer
* Sherical harmonics calculation functions

## About to commit

* GPU Raytracer (CUDA)
* Test cases using gtest (Google C++ Testing Framework)
* Simple wrapper for Irrlicht open source engine
* Sample (for test) real-time raytracer
* Sample (for test) real-time ambient occlusion with raytracer

## Working on...

* Precomputed Radiance Transfer(PRT) shadowed-diffuse sample (using irrlicht open source engine)
* Real-time radiosity (without lightmap-baking)
* SSE Raytracer

## And.. later...

* Lightmap baking
* GPU Raytracer (OpenCL)
* Many interesting techniques mainly about spherical harmonics
* Interactive photon mapping
* Voxel
